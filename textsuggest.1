  textsuggest is a simple X11 utility that autocompletes, suggests and expands words in the GUI\.
.
.SH "USAGE"
  textsuggest has two modes:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4

.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\'insert\' mode : Gives a list of all known words, allowing you to search them and choose one\. Activated with \fB\-\-noselect\fR option\.
.
.IP
